# Banditron

This repository implements the code in [Efficient Bandit Algorithms for Online Multiclass Prediction (Kakade et al 2008)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1390156.1390212?casa_token=_zuKCr69BFoAAAAA:WLHFurG8A1nvv_AAbj9eLcONpyEA3HMrtwaZ_Rzs7jG7R99G01VmvlYZ2MQQ85zzzk9OAdrLgcOi3A).

# Update

I found this idea of adjusting gamma value to minimize expected number of errors has been well studied by [Valizadegan et al (KDD '11)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2020408.2020445). Hence further research on this topic will not be continued and this repository is now archived.
